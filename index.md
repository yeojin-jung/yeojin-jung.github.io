<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;">About</h2>

I am a PhD candidate in Statistics at the University of Chicago. My research focuses on statistical methods for **high-dimensional and structured data**, with applications to problems such as spatial transcriptomics, graph-based modeling, and large-scale machine learning. I also work on **conformal prediction** and **data selection** for efficient training of large generative models. I aim to develop methods that are both theoretically grounded and practically useful for complex scientific datasets.
