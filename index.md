<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;">About</h2>

Hi! I am a PhD candidate in Statistics at the University of Chicago, working in the [SIGNAL Lab](https://signal-lab-uchicago.github.io/) advised by [Professor Claire Donnat](https://donnate.github.io/). 

My research focuses on statistical methods for **high-dimensional and structured data**, especially low-rank methods such as topic models, SVD, and PCA with applications to data that has graphical or spatial structure (e.g. spatial transcriptomics). Currently, I am also working on **conditional conformal prediction** and **data selection** for inference and efficient training of large generative models. I enjoy both statistical theory and its implementation in Python or R.

Previously, I completed my BA and MA in Applied Statistics at Yonsei University in South Korea, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Professor Jaewoo Park](https://sites.google.com/view/jwpark88/home) and [Professor Ick Hoon Jin](https://sites.google.com/view/jinius-lab/home). During my master’s, I focused on Bayesian approaches to autologistic models and functional regression.
